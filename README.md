# FCC-Pomodoro-Clock
1.  Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/VemPZX.
2.  Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
3.  Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
4.  User Story: I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
5.  User Story: I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
6.  User Story: I can customize the length of each pomodoro.
7.  Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
8.  When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen. 
9.  You can get feedback on your project from fellow campers by sharing it in our Code Review Chatroom. You can also share it on Twitter and your city's Campsite (on Facebook).
